# ERC20-token
# Project Title:
 A Smart contract to create your own ERC20 token.
# Description:
The Token project uses Solidity to produce a personalised ERC-20 token on the Ethereum network. The ERC-20 token standard establishes a set of guidelines and conduct that all ERC-20 tokens have to adhere to, and ERC-20 tokens are fungible tokens that meet these requirements. The goal of Creating Token is to offer a basic ERC-20 token that exhibits necessary features like minting, transferring, burning, and mechanisms for allowing ownership control. Token ecosystems, token-based economies, and decentralised apps (dApps) can all be integrated with or built upon this token as a foundation for future experimentation.
# Getting Started: 
To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension. (e.g., Tokensol).Copy and paste the following code into the file:
